[[boot-features-configure-r2dbc-connectionfactory]]
=== Configure a R2DBC ConnectionFactory
R2DBC's `io.r2dbc.spi.Connection` interface provides a standard method of working
with non-blocking database connections . Traditionally, a 'ConnectionFactory' uses a `URL`
along with some credentials to establish a database connection.

TIP: See <<howto-configure-a-connectionfactory,the "`How-to`" section>> for more
advanced examples, typically to take full control over the configuration of the
ConnectionFactory.

[[boot-features-embedded-database-support]]
==== Embedded Database Support
It is often convenient to develop applications by using an in-memory embedded database.
Obviously, in-memory databases do not provide persistent storage. You need to populate
your database when your application starts and be prepared to throw away data when your
application ends.

TIP: The "`How-to`" section includes a <<howto.adoc#howto-database-initialization,
section on how to initialize a database>>.

Spring Boot can auto-configure embedded https://www.h2database.com[H2],
for reactive usage. You need not provide any connection URLs.
You need only include a build dependency to the embedded database that you want to use.

[NOTE]
====
If you are using this feature in your tests, you may notice that the same database is
reused by your whole test suite regardless of the number of application contexts that you
use. If you want to make sure that each context has a separate embedded database, you
should set `spring.r2dbc.generate-unique-name` to `true`.
====

[NOTE]
====
Embedded databases are typically used through JDBC. Using R2DBC H2 gives you access to
the same embedded database instance and you can access data through JDBC and R2DBC.
====

For example, the typical POM dependencies would be as follows:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
	<dependency>
		<groupId>org.springframework.boot.experimental</groupId>
		<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-r2dbc</artifactId>
	</dependency>
	<dependency>
		<groupId>io.r2dbc</groupId>
		<artifactId>r2dbc-h2</artifactId>
		<scope>runtime</scope>
	</dependency>
----

[[boot-features-connect-to-r2dbc-production-database]]
==== Connection to a Production Database
Production database connections can also be auto-configured by using a pooling
`ConnectionFactory`.

TIP: Additional connection pools can always be configured manually. If you define your
own `ConnectionFactory` bean, auto-configuration does not occur.

ConnectionFactory configuration is controlled by external configuration properties in
`+spring.r2dbc.*+`. For example, you might declare the following section in
`application.properties`:

[source,properties,indent=0]
----
	spring.r2dbc.url=r2dbc:postgresql://localhost/test
	spring.r2dbc.username=dbuser
	spring.r2dbc.password=dbpass
----

NOTE: You should at least specify the URL by setting the `spring.r2dbc.url`
property. Otherwise, Spring Boot tries to auto-configure an embedded database.

TIP: You do not need to specify a driver class name, since Spring Boot obtains
the driver from R2DBC's Connection Factory discovery.

[[boot-features-using-database-client]]
=== Using DatabaseClient
Spring Data's `DatabaseClient` class is auto-configured, and
you can `@Autowire` it directly into your own beans, as shown in the following example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
	import org.springframework.data.r2dbc.function.DatabaseClient;
	import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

	@Component
	public class MyBean {

		private final DatabaseClient databaseClient;

		@Autowired
		public MyBean(DatabaseClient databaseClient) {
			this.databaseClient = databaseClient;
		}

		// ...

	}
----

[[boot-features-spring-data-r2dbc-repositories]]
==== Spring Data R2DBC Repositories
https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-r2dbc[Spring Data R2DBC] repositories are interfaces that you can define to
access data. Queries are created automatically from your method names. For example, a
`CityRepository` interface might declare a `findAllByState(String state)` method to find
all the cities in a given state.

For more complex queries, you can annotate your method with Spring Data's
https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/r2dbc/docs/1.0.x/api/org/springframework/data/r2dbc/repository/query/Query.html[`Query`] annotation.

Spring Data repositories usually extend from the
{spring-data-commons-javadoc}/repository/Repository.html[`Repository`] or
{spring-data-commons-javadoc}/repository/reactive/ReactiveCrudRepository.html[`ReactiveCrudRepository`]
interfaces. If you use auto-configuration, repositories are searched from the package
containing your main configuration class (the one annotated with
`@EnableAutoConfiguration` or `@SpringBootApplication`) down.

The following example shows a typical Spring Data repository interface definition:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
	package com.example.myapp.domain;

	import org.springframework.data.domain.*;
	import org.springframework.data.repository.*;
	import reactor.core.publisher.Mono;

	public interface CityRepository extends Repository<City, Long> {

		Mono<City> findByNameAndStateAllIgnoringCase(String name, String state);

	}
----

TIP: We have barely scratched the surface of Spring Data R2DBC. For complete details, see
the https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/r2dbc/docs/1.0.x/reference/html/[Spring Data R2DBC
reference documentation].

[[howto-configure-a-connectionfactory]]
=== Configure a Custom ConnectionFactory
To configure your own `ConnectionFactory`, define a `@Bean` of that type in your configuration.
Spring Boot reuses your `ConnectionFactory` anywhere one is required, including database
initialization. If you need to externalize some settings, you can bind your
`ConnectionFactory` to the environment (see
"`<<spring-boot-features.adoc#boot-features-external-config-3rd-party-configuration>>`").

The following example shows how to define a data source in a bean:

[source,java,indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
	@Bean
	public ConnectionFactory connectionFactory() {
		return new FancyConnectionFactory();
	}
----

[[howto-customize-connections]]
=== Customize connection parameters
To customize the connections created by a `ConnectionFactory`, i.e., set specific
parameters that you do not want (or cannot) configure in your central database
configuration, you can use a `ConnectionFactoryOptionsBuilderCustomizer` `@Bean`.

The following example shows how to manually override the database port while
the rest of the options is taken from the application configuration:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
    @Bean
    public ConnectionFactoryOptionsBuilderCustomizer customizer() {
        return (builder) -> builder.option(PORT, 5432);
    }
----

The following examples shows how to set some PostgreSQL connection options:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
    @Bean
    public ConnectionFactoryOptionsBuilderCustomizer customizer() {
        Map<String, String> options = new HashMap<>();
        options.put("lock_timeout", "30s");
        options.put("statement_timeout", "60s");

        return (builder) -> builder.option(OPTIONS, options);
    }
----

[[howto-database-initialization]]
== Database Initialization
An SQL database can be initialized in different ways depending on what your stack is.
Of course, you can also do it manually, provided the database is a separate process.
It is recommended to use a single mechanism for schema generation.


[[howto-initialize-a-database-using-spring-data-r2dbc]]
=== Initialize a Database using R2DBC
Spring Boot can automatically create the schema (DDL scripts) of your `ConnectionFactory` and
initialize it (DML scripts). It loads SQL from the standard root classpath locations:
`schema.sql` and `data.sql`, respectively. In addition, Spring Boot processes the
`schema-${platform}.sql` and `data-${platform}.sql` files (if present), where `platform`
is the value of `spring.r2dbc.platform`. This allows you to switch to
database-specific scripts if necessary. For example, you might choose to set it to the
vendor name of the database ( `h2`, `mysql`, `postgresql`, and so on).

[NOTE]
====
Spring Boot automatically creates the schema of an embedded `ConnectionFactory`. This
behaviour can be customized by using the `spring.r2dbc.initialization-mode` property.
For instance, if you want to always initialize the `ConnectionFactory` regardless of its type:

[indent=0,subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
	spring.r2dbc.initialization-mode=always
----
====

By default, Spring Boot enables the fail-fast feature of the Spring Data R2DBC initializer.
This means that, if the scripts cause exceptions, the application fails to start.
You can tune that behavior by setting `spring.r2dbc.continue-on-error`.

NOTE: Using embedded database auto-configuration for JDBC and R2DBC lets the R2DBC
database initialization to back off to prevent double initialization as both database
technologies point to the same database.
